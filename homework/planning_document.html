        <p>My Peer reviewer is Scott Croft.</p>
        <p>My sketches of wireframe were very large and at the beginning I couldn’t see the whole picture in my screen. Yes, the pictures were very huge. I was wondering how I could fix it. Scott helped to use paint and resize my wireframes. I made a change and the pictures are smaller and visible on the screen. I also resized the persona’s picture. Scot suggested to me to relocate the persona’s picture at the appropriate location.</P>
